### The Need for speed
### The DevOps revolution and balancing speed with safety

Agile development is enough. We iterate and develop quickly. Zend survey reports 87% of developers experience a delay in rolling code out to production. Breakdown of reasons for delay:

* 41% inconcistent environments
* 27% no automation
* 15% lack of collaboration with ops
* 9% No visibility to production
* 8% Other

Most companies deploy to production in days, not hours, rare for companies to do it in minutes. 

Lessons from trying to get continuous delivery going with clients:

1. Version control is the base
2. Version control doesn't just mean the code
3. Always be production ready isn't so easy. Assumes fully automated testing and rehersal of the deployment process
4. Automated deployement. Sure. Someone may want to hit the button
5. The rollback debate
6. Feedback = king. App insight = essential. (Rely on your users to improve the app, not to tell you it doesn't work.)
7. You can't automate a culture of quality.

Displayed some stats that show continuous delivery gets results...

* Increase in revenue
* Increased collaboration between departments
* Reduced time to market
* Improved quality of deployed applications
* Reduction in spend on development and operations
