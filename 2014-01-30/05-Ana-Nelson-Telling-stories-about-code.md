### Telling stories about code

Story Crisis - Many stories competing for peoples attentions, all too often the "wrong" stories win. Could be in politics, marketing, anywhere. 

Example around cancer research, a major concern is reproducabiity. 1.3 million dollars to verify findings of 50 high profile papers. Meta analysis, whoever pays for the study gets the results that they want. 

Krugman Excel Depression in NYT as another result, excel error, but was widely cited before error was clarified.

Dexy -

* Tool for reproducability
* Makes sure math is right

* Links words in a story to the data and code
* Data, Code, Workflow -> Document environment

Final result gives a value. 

### Not only problem

Its not just computational reproducability. Starts really at asking the right question. 

### How are we tricked by stories

Science is unintuitive. We have natural heuristics to make quick decisions, but when dealing with large data and details we're often wrong. If story quickly appeals to our intuition we can agree and let go even if wrong.

### What do stories teach us

* Theory of mind - Think about what we know, but make assessments about what others know
