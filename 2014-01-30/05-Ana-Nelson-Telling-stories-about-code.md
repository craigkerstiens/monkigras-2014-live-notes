Story Crisis - Many stories competing for peoples attentions, all too often the "wrong" stories win. Could be in politics, marketing, anywhere. 

Example around cancer research, a major concern is reproducabiity. 1.3 million dollars to verify findings of 50 high profile papers. Meta analysis, whoever pays for the study gets the results that they want. 

Krugman Excel Depression in NYT as another result, excel error, but was widely cited before error was clarified.

Dexy -

* Tool for reproducability
* Makes sure math is right

* Links words in a story to the data and code
* Data, Code, Workflow -> Document environment

Final result gives a value.
