### Sharing is Caring

Fruit flies - Thomas morgan hunt geneticist, started using them for experimentation. Low maintenance, short life span - full generation in 10 minutes. Minimum chromosomes, made for easy manipulation. Top Coder is like a fruit fly, run over 50,000 challenges, lots of small quick tests.

While this is about craft, it has to map to big pieces.

*Systems can share and care too*

Example of bioinformatics where they gave a problem and applied three approaches to how it was solved. Three methods

* Some people solved on their own
* Some solved on their own, but once they submitted answer it was open for reiew
* Some collaborated from the onset

The results highlighted that intermediate disclosures proved both common knowledge as well as improved results. More collaboration means more similar answer set, more individual meant more broad answers but more effort exerted. 

Codified this set of values into their process. First part of the process is independent, at a checkpoint person thats consuming the design gives feedback. Then theres a final round with a winner selected. 

### Go with the flow or get it done?
