### James Governor Welcome

* 29 beers to be tasted
* Weird themes
* Large crowd of alumni

### Lanyrds

They're a weird thing. Draw attention to the chest, which isn't what everyone (women) always want. That was good enough reason for James. Tailed back the numbers this year, to make meeting easier. But you have to do it the old fashioned way now. Some background on the space

* Used to just moan about not having a space, decided to finally do something.
* A redmonk space now
* 100 desks for co-working
* Meetups/events/etc.

### Monkigras

Its about craft, its not just about industrial approaches. Outsourcing is great for business, except your customer service is shit (i.e. AT&T). Giving the developer pitch, agile, devops, etc, is a landgrab of developers staking their claim. Stephen joked about beer and tech as a conference, and shortly after they were running a conference around it. James is rambling about his rambling and being behind on the schedule, so the show gets rolling.

Notable James quotes:

* *"Silicon valley is a thing cause internet"*
* *"I'm half yank half British and it shows. I'm full of shit and complain about everything"*
