### Bug Rotation - What bugs taught us about people

Etsy deploys 60 times per day. They treat code as craft.

Large bug backlog, they wanted to reduce. It's difficult to get developer to work on fixing bugs in code they didn't write.

They came up with the concept of bug rotation. Engineers had one day a month to work on bug fixes. Managers took it in turn to manage bug rotation for one week. People could pick any bug to work on.

Initially the bug count fell rapidly, but once the "low hanging fruit" was picked people started to not like bug rotation. The project was almost scrapped but it turned out that "Support loves bug rotation".

### Iterating Processes

Processes involving people need to be iterated like products and code.

* one dedicated manager
* people were allowed to opt out of bug rotation "mandates kill enthusiasm"
* support prioritised the bug backlog
* people finish for the day once a bug is fixed
* engineers pair on bug rotation
